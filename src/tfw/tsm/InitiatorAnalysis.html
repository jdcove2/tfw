<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>Initiator Analysis</H1>
	Initiators are used to change state in a new transaction. 
	<UL>
	<LI>Leaf components can not create initiators because they can not add
	them to the component structure.</LI>
	<LI>If a leaf component needs an initiator, it is passed in through the 
	constructor. This approach causes a problem. The event channel 
	description associated with the initiator is unknown to the leaf 
	component.</LI>
	<LI>We need to add initiator event channel descriptions to the 
	constructors of leaf components.</LI>
	<LI>Add an initiate(EventChannelDescription) method to leaf components.</LI>
